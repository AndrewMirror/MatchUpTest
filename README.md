# MatchUpTest
A python program that on input takes a match up chart of for example a fighting game, simulates a lot of matches as if the match up numbers are accurate, and gives out a graph of the matches with the meta adjustments.

Inside the program change the csv file name to your chart's. Example csv's are provided

If needed, change the low pick rade bound, "AlwaysPick" variable, it's set to 1.7% which is 5 times less than expected normal pickrate from 12 characters randomly.
I suggest producing graphs on multiple AlwaysPick values to get the best view on the meta.
